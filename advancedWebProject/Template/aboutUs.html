                Hey there! We're the team behind Spark Code Academy, a group of students from Lakeview
                Technology Academy with over three years of programming experience. We've honed our skills in various
                programming languages used daily in the tech world. Our mission is to inspire younger students to dive into
                coding, boosting their problem-solving skills, tech savvy, and understanding of the digital landscape. We've
                poured hundreds of hours into sharpening our expertise as programmers. Bring your students to our meetings
                to kickstart their coding journey!
